        <p>It‚Äôs McrFRED next week, and it‚Äôs lightning talks. I will be practicing my talk about code reviews.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, you do code reviews, and that‚Äôs great. But there‚Äôs always more that you can check during the review. More places you can check for any potential bugs or problems before deployment, before you find yourself with technical debt. Or worse: unforeseen downtime.</p>

  <p>In this talk Clair will be going through the things that you should be checking to ensure confidence for developers, project owners and stakeholders. We‚Äôll be looking at documentation, commit messages, and common code problems, with examples and tips along the way.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/2015-12/searching-emails-datetime-google-mail">Searching for emails by date/time in Google Mail</a>
        </h2>
        <p>I‚Äôve recently had need to search for emails received after a specific time: as in, ‚ÄúAfter 3pm on the 1st January 2016‚Äù, and not ‚ÄúAfter the 1st January 2016‚Äù.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en">Google‚Äôs documentation</a> isn‚Äôt very helpful with this, and all I could find on Google‚Äôs help pages are <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/ANLd2eTCNLM">unhelpful ‚Äúnope‚Äù answers</a>.</p>

<p>I disbelieved that this is something Google would neglect to allow for so long. Luckily, I was correct.</p>

<p>You can achieve this if you use the <a href="http://www.epochconverter.com/">Epoch timestamp</a> instead. For example, to get all emails sent/received since 3pm on the 1st January 2016 (in GMT), all I need to do is search for:</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Katie Sherwin, for Nielsen Norman Group, nails it when it comes to TV spoilers on the HBO Now service:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much to my dismay though, each time I click on the Game of Thrones thumbnail, it reveals a big image of the latest episode ‚Äî complete with characters that I didn‚Äôt know were still alive, in contexts that give away the plot. I see who is together arm in arm, which villains are undeservedly still in power, and which heroes are alive and in jail.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I literally have to block the screen with my hands each time I go to watch an episode. A friend of mine uses the squint approach: half looking away in order to blur the revealing images and summary text, while he maneuvers the mouse to the correct season.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And she perfectly sums up the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Satisfying multiple sets of user needs doesn‚Äôt mean designing for the lowest common denominator. It‚Äôs about empathy with the different use cases and making sure that the content for one audience, even if it‚Äôs a main audience, doesn‚Äôt ruin the experience for a different use case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. It‚Äôs the modern equivalent of looking away from seeing the football results.</p>

<p>Which reminds me: I‚Äôve lost count the number of times BBC News have spoilt the F1 results for me beforethey air the extended highlights show‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs to the crazy ones. 
The misfits. 
The rebels. 
The troublemakers. 
The round pegs in the square holes. 
The ones who see things differently.</p>

<p>They‚Äôre not fond of rules. 
And they have no respect for the status quo.</p>

<p>You can quote them, 
Disagree with them, 
Glorify or vilify them.</p>

<p>About the only thing you can‚Äôt do 
Is ignore them.</p>

<p>Because they change things. 
They push the human race forward.</p>

<p>And while some may see them as the crazy ones, 
We see genius.</p>

<p>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, 
Are the ones who do.</p>

        <p>A fair number of passwords from the Ashley Maddison hack have now been cracked. Click through if you want to see the (NSFW) top 100 list, but you wont see many surprises.</p>

<p>ARS Technica:</p>

  <p>As bad as it is that 11.7 million accounts were protected by weak passwords, there‚Äôs yet another number the underscores just how careless the Ashley Madison masses were: Only 4.6 million of the 11.7 million recovered passwords were unique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I did my maths correct, around 5% of all accounts (or 1 in 20) had passwords in that top 100 list.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>It wasn‚Äôt so long ago that when you had a problem with any of your Apple products, you could drop by your local Apple Store and a friendly fellow geek would sort you how: in the case of hardware, usually by confirming the issue and giving you a replacement there and then.</p>

<p>But Apple products are getting more popular, and the Stores are getting busier. Gone are the days where you could just pop in: you‚Äôve needed to book an appointment for some time now. And gone are the days where you knew you were talking to a fellow Apple geek who could get you on your feet there and then. Now, it‚Äôs a pleasant surprise if you get this.</p>

<p>Those who listen to <a href="http://atp.fm/">ATP</a> will know, possibly to their own frustration, about the issue where <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/crescentgate-problem-with-the-iphone-6-selfie-camera-2014-12">part of the front-facing camera is shifting</a> to give an appearance of a grey crescent moon. (And for those who hadn‚Äôt: I‚Äôm sorry, you can no longer un-see it). And earlier today, <a href="http://caseyliss.com/">Casey</a> sent a <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/641242250446536704">tweet reminder</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iPhone 6 users with the crescent moon: if you got yours launch day like me, your warranty runs out ~18 September. http://t.co/txx5zRqug6</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so good. There‚Äôs a clear defect with your phone and you have just over a week to get a fix or replacement under regular warranty.</p>

<p>But then I delved into the replies to this tweet. And the results were mixed, to say the least:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alan0606/status/641244299162554368">@alan0606</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss Casey thanks to you pointing it out on ATP I booked genius appointment. Genius replaced mine with a brand new iPhone 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/brandoncozart/status/641245447164571649">@brandoncozart</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss took mine in a couple of weeks ago with this issue. fix took about 10 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/twistofmatt/status/641251888881491972">@twistofmatt</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss I was told as long as it wasn‚Äôt interfering with the function of the camera to live with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/legerlotz/status/641243327636094976">@legerlotz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss I was told that this was a ‚Äúnormal variance‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt get it fixed until it affected the photos taken by the FaceTime camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would appear Apple Genius support is being inconsistant with this issue, with some owners being told it isn‚Äôt a problem.</p>

<p>Is it time Apple re-thought their after-sales support strategy?</p>
