        <h2>Apple&#39;s Genius Bar just isn&#39;t working anymore
        </h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>It wasn’t so long ago that when you had a problem with any of your Apple products, you could drop by your local Apple Store and a friendly fellow geek would sort you how: in the case of hardware, usually by confirming the issue and giving you a replacement there and then.</p>

<p>But Apple products are getting more popular, and the Stores are getting busier. Gone are the days where you could just pop in: you’ve needed to book an appointment for some time now. And gone are the days where you knew you were talking to a fellow Apple geek who could get you on your feet there and then. Now, it’s a pleasant surprise if you get this.</p>

<p>Those who listen to <a href="http://atp.fm/">ATP</a> will know, possibly to their own frustration, about the issue where <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/crescentgate-problem-with-the-iphone-6-selfie-camera-2014-12">part of the front-facing camera is shifting</a> to give an appearance of a grey crescent moon. (And for those who hadn’t: I’m sorry, you can no longer un-see it). And earlier today, <a href="http://caseyliss.com/">Casey</a> sent a <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/641242250446536704">tweet reminder</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iPhone 6 users with the crescent moon: if you got yours launch day like me, your warranty runs out ~18 September. http://t.co/txx5zRqug6</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so good. There’s a clear defect with your phone and you have just over a week to get a fix or replacement under regular warranty.</p>

<p>But then I delved into the replies to this tweet. And the results were mixed, to say the least:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alan0606/status/641244299162554368">@alan0606</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss Casey thanks to you pointing it out on ATP I booked genius appointment. Genius replaced mine with a brand new iPhone 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/brandoncozart/status/641245447164571649">@brandoncozart</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss took mine in a couple of weeks ago with this issue. fix took about 10 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/twistofmatt/status/641251888881491972">@twistofmatt</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss I was told as long as it wasn’t interfering with the function of the camera to live with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/legerlotz/status/641243327636094976">@legerlotz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@caseyliss I was told that this was a “normal variance” and couldn’t get it fixed until it affected the photos taken by the FaceTime camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would appear Apple Genius support is being inconsistant with this issue, with some owners being told it isn’t a problem.</p>

<p>Is it time Apple re-thought their after-sales support strategy?</p>
