        <h2>On Apple buying Workflow
        </h2>
    </header>

    <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I’m sure over the next few days, there will be lots of opinion pieces written and published by lots of different people over the news that Apple have purchased Workflow.</p>

<p>My opinion, however, isn’t that special. It’s little more than “oh, that’s pretty cool. They wrote a great app, so good that Apple wanted in. They did pretty well there!”.</p>

<p>But there’s one part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/">Techcrunch article announcing the deal</a> which struck with me. It’s near the bottom, and it’s a couple of paragraphs about some words Apple said about the app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple confirmed the deal, and has said the following about Workflow:</p>

  <p>“The Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.”</p>

  <p>The accessibility features of Workflow are super impressive, especially for an app that is a tool for building complicated macros. It would have been much easier to say hey, this is for heavy users maybe we don’t need to make sure it’s 100% accessible — but they didn’t, and they won a bunch of awards (and an exit) for their trouble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s all too easy to say that in an advanced app for pro users, with a lot of complicated features, accessibility isn’t at the top of the priority list. But Workflow has proven that it’s still an important thing for app developers to worry about.</p>

<p>And Apple, apparently, agrees.</p>
