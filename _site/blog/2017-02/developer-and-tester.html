        <h2>Developer and Tester
        </h2>

        <p>On my personal business card, it says “Software Developer/Tester”. I usually call myself a “Software Engineer”. I develop, and I test. And my CV has plenty of skills and experience in both.</p>

<p>But, can I really do both? Surely I can only do one or the other? Does it make me indecisive about my career choice and career path?</p>

<p>The short answers are yes, no, and no.</p>

<p>Let me give you the long answers</p>

<h2 id="can-i-really-do-both">Can I really do both?</h2>

<p>Why not? There is a lot of overlap in development and QA. Good project teams generally, in my opinion, are more successful when the developer and the tester are in constant communication.</p>

<p>It’s true, I prefer to test software than develop it, but that doesn’t mean I can’t develop software (or write automated tests) when the need arises. And it doesn’t mean I don’t have my own personal projects where I’m developing.</p>

<h2 id="surely-i-can-only-do-one-or-the-other">Surely I can only do one or the other?</h2>
<p>We all know that in the tech industry, there’s specialists and generalists. Some argue that being one is better than the other. Me, I think that both types of people have very valuable skills that are useful in a project.</p>

<p>Very early in my career, I decided I was going to be a generalist. I was interested in a lot of things (I still am. My secret to being a good listener is I am genuinely interested in what the other person is talking about. Even if it’s about their trip to Morecambe with Aunt Sally. I just love to know things).</p>

<p>So I learnt as much as I could about development. I learnt PHP, and I learnt JavaScript. I learnt about Linux, because that’s what web servers ran on. There are people out there who know lots more about topics than I do, and honestly, it frustrates me. But I also know, I have enough baseline knowledge to be able to pick stuff up.</p>

<p>It’s the same now I’m testing. I might be a tester by day, but by night I’m learning Swift. I’ll never be the expert in iOS development, and I’ll probably have to Google some syntax, but I know enough to do a very good job.</p>

<p>I would prefer to also be able to test very well. I’m almost certain that there will be a “Selenium expert” who knows more than me, but does that really matter when I have enough broad knowledge to learn what I need to know?</p>

<h2 id="does-it-make-me-indecisive-about-my-career-choice-and-career-path">Does it make me indecisive about my career choice and career path?</h2>

<p>No. My day job is as a tester, with my career plan being to one day, be a test manager. And, if you ask me, the best managers are generalists. But that’s probably a blog post for another day…</p>
