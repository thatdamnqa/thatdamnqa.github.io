<blockquote>
  <p>So, you do code reviews, and that‚Äôs great. But there‚Äôs always more that you can check during the review. More places you can check for any potential bugs or problems before deployment, before you find yourself with technical debt. Or worse: unforeseen downtime.</p>

  <p>In this talk Clair will be going through the things that you should be checking to ensure confidence for developers, project owners and stakeholders. We‚Äôll be looking at documentation, commit messages, and common code problems, with examples and tips along the way.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/2016-10/suggestion-conference-organisers">‚òÖ &nbsp;A suggestion for conference organisers</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Conferences are great, I really enjoy going to them. But also, I find conferences can be difficult to be at.</p>

<p>I suffer from anxiety, and from time to time it can be difficult to deal with. Things that I struggle with are being in a place with lots of people (especially people I don‚Äôt know), being in places where there‚Äôs a lot of chatter or a loud noise from a microphone, and learning difficult or new things. So, basically things that by design you get at conferences.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it isn‚Äôt a problem at all. I can usually cope for a while if it is a problem. But often I just need to get away from it all for a few moments.</p>

<p>So, I have a suggestion for all conference organisers. Can we have some kind of ‚Äúquiet space‚Äù for people to escape to? Somewhere away from the usual hustle and bustle of the conference where I can just sit down with a cup of tea<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, perhaps catching up on twitter. Being by myself where my brain can recover.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt need to be a separate room. Just some space away from the main break area (ie. away from the sponsor hall), that‚Äôs clearly defined as ‚ÄúI need to take five minutes‚Äù space.</p>

<p>Because often, as much as I‚Äôm enjoying the talks and meeting old and new friends, all my brain wants to do is run away. And my brain will thank you for providing somewhere I can run to.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Which brings me to another suggestion, this one for conference caterers: please don‚Äôt take away refreshments just because the talks are on. Not everybody goes to every talk. And no, jugs of water and small glasses don‚Äôt count as refreshments.¬†<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/2016-10/five-years">‚òÖ &nbsp;Five years</a>
        </h2>
        <p>It‚Äôs been five years since Steve Jobs was cruelly taken away from us.</p>

<p>In those five years, multiple biographies have been written, business books have been published promising the ‚ÄúSteve Jobs way‚Äù, and many anecdotes have been told from people who have been lucky enough to meet, or work with, the man.</p>

<p>Jobs has touched many of our lives; whether it‚Äôs through the phone we use or the way we listen to our music. But for me, he also touched my life by showing me what uncompromising looks like.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uncompromising is being sacked from the company he founded, only to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">lick his wounds and start again</a></li>
  <li>Uncompromising is <a href="http://blog.extensis.com/apple/steve-jobs-typography.php">using beautiful typography</a></li>
  <li>Uncompromising is building a mouse <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C4cvbIbustkC&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=aKUQDXuE62&amp;dq=steve%20jobs%20mouse%20jeans&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">that you can use on your jeans</a></li>
  <li>Uncompromising is being unhappy with the mobile phone market, so making your own</li>
  <li>Uncompromising is making <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/steve-jobs-imac-no-interest-to-apple_n_6692530.html">a computer that isn‚Äôt a beige box</a></li>
  <li>Uncompromising is <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/patents/USD478999">patenting a design for a better staircase</a>, when you aren‚Äôt in the staircase business</li>
  <li>Uncompromising is <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">saying no to Flash</a>, when everybody else is saying yes</li>
  <li>Uncompromising is <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2221536/data-center/inside-apple-s-secret-packaging-room.html">creating hundreds of prototypes of a box</a>, to find the best product packaging for an iPod</li>
</ul>

<p>Like many, I still think about Jobs from time to time, and the things he gave the world. The technology he gave us is obvious, but it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm the most thankful for.</p>

<p>What I am the most thankful for, is being shown that it‚Äôs ok to never be satisfied, and instead to think about every last detail. Because it‚Äôs the small stuff that makes the world a better place.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/2016-08/testing-and-being-tester">‚òÖ &nbsp;Testing, and being a tester</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Gem Hill made a <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Enc7-bshs">really interesting episode of her podcast</a>, talking about how she became a tester, and invited people to speak about their stories.</p>

<p>Like almost every other tester, I kinda fell into it by accident. Like Gem (spoiler alert) I started by testing, realising I quite enjoyed doing it and had a natural talent for it, and so decided to become a tester.</p>

<p>Almost by coincidence, the company I worked at was both moving the platform to a language I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äî and still can‚Äôt ‚Äî grasp, and building up their test team. Given I did some testing previously (agile, people!) and didn‚Äôt completely suck at it, the switch was a no brainer.</p>

<p>The day before I was due to move team, my soon-to-be manager checked how I was. My response was a barely understandable panicked mash of worry.</p>

<p>The day I moved, and the subsequent days afterwards, I found myself talking with the others in the team like I‚Äôd been there forever. That all testers seem to have the same sense of humour generally helped.</p>

<p>It was that week I realised I was no longer testing: I was a tester. Almost two years later, I‚Äôm starting to scale back the amount of development I do.</p>

<p>(It was that week I was also introduced to Inside Number 9, which after a few episodes I decided was far too creepy‚Ä¶)</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="http://www.imore.com/seeing-apple-through-color-blind-lens">Colour blindness and iphoneüîó</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Jason Snell has written an interesting article on colour blindness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The design of Apple‚Äôs MagSafe chargers are a case in point: They contain a clever design to indicate your charging status at a glance ‚Äî green means charged, amber means charging, and no light means that there‚Äôs no power or connection.</p>

  <p>Except, well‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt really tell the difference between the green and the amber lights at a glance. For a long time, I didn‚Äôt even realize the light on the MagSafe connector changed color. (Apple is far from alone here ‚Äî lots of electronics use subtle color shifts of an LED to indicate things in a way that I simply can‚Äôt digest.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I do love that Apple are trying to make things easier:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In iOS 10, Apple will let users filter their entire display, whether that‚Äôs applying grayscale, red/green filters for both protanopia and deuteranopia color blindness, and a blue/yellow filter for a very different form of color blindness called tritanopia. There‚Äôs also an option to just overlay a color tint of any hue or intensity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a discussion with someone last week about how developers can, and do, keep disability and individual circumstances in mind. When asked what kind of built in features were built into the iPhone for accessibility, the list in my head was growing as I thought of more and more.</p>

<p>The answer I verbally gave was ‚Äúgosh, loads!‚Äù.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs nice that Apple are growing accessibility features for iOS year after year, even though they don‚Äôt have to. I like that they see it as their social responsibility to do so.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Of all things I have an opinion on, the shape of headphone jacks is perhaps one of the most benign. I prefer L-shaped jacks, as opposed to straight ones. The reasoning is simple:</p>

<p>Women‚Äôs jeans have stupidly small pockets, and the only way you‚Äôre going to fit a phone in there is if you put it in sideways. This means that there will be a snug fit for the headphone jack.</p>

<p>The cable inevitably needs to fold at around 90 degrees to go out the pocket, which inevitably stresses (and breaks) the headphones.</p>

<p>The L-shaped jack solves this problem by bending the cable with no stress. Perfect for women‚Äôs trousers.</p>

<p>CNET recently spoke with Sean Garret, VP at Bose, about the shape of a headphone jack (L-shaped vs straight), explaining why all modern jacks are straight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You naturally slide your phone into your pocket so the cable comes straight out of your pocket first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see nobody in Bose‚Äôs design team wears women‚Äôs clothing.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Something that‚Äôs been on my mind for some time, but have never been able to find a way to put it across. Eevee does it perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accept that sometimes, or for some people, your JavaScript will not work. Put some thought into what that means. Err on the side of basing your work on existing HTML mechanisms whenever you can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! We have (largely) moved on from noscript tags, but javascript can (and does) do weird things in weird ways, simply because you can‚Äôt control the environment.</p>

<p>So whenever you can, don‚Äôt expect your scripts to download, or work.</p>

<p>Or, as I like to think about it: if you are rewriting a browser control, ask yourself why.</p>
