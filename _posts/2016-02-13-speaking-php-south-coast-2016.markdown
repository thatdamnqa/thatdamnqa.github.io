I'm really excited to be speaking at [PHP South Coast](http://2016.phpsouthcoast.co.uk/) this year.

It is their second conference, and for me has already become the highlight of the UK conference year. This year's schedule is a fantastic one, and I'm proud to be part of it.

[Early Bird tickets](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/php-south-coast-conference-2016-tickets-20336186080?aff=weblanding) are still available.
