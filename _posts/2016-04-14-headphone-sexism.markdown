Of all things I have an opinion on, the shape of headphone jacks is perhaps one of the most benign. I prefer L-shaped jacks, as opposed to straight ones. The reasoning is simple:

Women's jeans have stupidly small pockets, and the only way you're going to fit a phone in there is if you put it in sideways. This means that there will be a snug fit for the headphone jack.

The cable inevitably needs to fold at around 90 degrees to go out the pocket, which inevitably stresses (and breaks) the headphones.

The L-shaped jack solves this problem by bending the cable with no stress. Perfect for women's trousers.

CNET recently spoke with Sean Garret, VP at Bose, about the shape of a headphone jack (L-shaped vs straight), explaining why all modern jacks are straight:

> You naturally slide your phone into your pocket so the cable comes straight out of your pocket first.

I see nobody in Bose's design team wears women's clothing.
