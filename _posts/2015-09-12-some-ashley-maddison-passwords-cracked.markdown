A fair number of passwords from the Ashley Maddison hack have now been cracked. Click through if you want to see the (NSFW) top 100 list, but you wont see many surprises.

ARS Technica:

> As bad as it is that 11.7 million accounts were protected by weak passwords, there's yet another number the underscores just how careless the Ashley Madison masses were: Only 4.6 million of the 11.7 million recovered passwords were unique.

If I did my maths correct, around 5% of all accounts (or 1 in 20) had passwords in that top 100 list.
