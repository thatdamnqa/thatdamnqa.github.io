It’s been five years since Steve Jobs was cruelly taken away from us.

In those five years, multiple biographies have been written, business books have been published promising the “Steve Jobs way”, and many anecdotes have been told from people who have been lucky enough to meet, or work with, the man.

Jobs has touched many of our lives; whether it’s through the phone we use or the way we listen to our music. But for me, he also touched my life by showing me what uncompromising looks like.

* Uncompromising is being sacked from the company he founded, only to [lick his wounds and start again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT)
* Uncompromising is [using beautiful typography](http://blog.extensis.com/apple/steve-jobs-typography.php)
* Uncompromising is building a mouse [that you can use on your jeans](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C4cvbIbustkC&lpg=PA93&ots=aKUQDXuE62&dq=steve%20jobs%20mouse%20jeans&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q&f=false)
* Uncompromising is being unhappy with the mobile phone market, so making your own
* Uncompromising is making [a computer that isn’t a beige box](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/16/steve-jobs-imac-no-interest-to-apple_n_6692530.html)
* Uncompromising is [patenting a design for a better staircase](http://www.google.co.uk/patents/USD478999), when you aren’t in the staircase business
* Uncompromising is [saying no to Flash](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/), when everybody else is saying yes
* Uncompromising is [creating hundreds of prototypes of a box](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2221536/data-center/inside-apple-s-secret-packaging-room.html), to find the best product packaging for an iPod

Like many, I still think about Jobs from time to time, and the things he gave the world. The technology he gave us is obvious, but it’s not what I’m the most thankful for.

What I am the most thankful for, is being shown that it’s ok to never be satisfied, and instead to think about every last detail. Because it’s the small stuff that makes the world a better place.
