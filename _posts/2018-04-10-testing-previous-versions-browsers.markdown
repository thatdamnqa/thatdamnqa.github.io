This is something that comes up quite a lot, so I decided to write down once and for all my opinion on supporting old versions of those browsers that are updated often.

This was a ten minute thread (and reply) that I posted to the Ministry of Testing Club.


>In recent years, Chrome and Firefox have started having regular release cycles on their browsers, which automatically update every 6 weeks or so.
>
>But the major problem is you can’t assume that everyone has restarted their browser to ensure they’re using the latest version, and you can’t easily download an old version of the browser and not have it automatically update while you’re testing.
>
>How does everybody go about browser testing, keeping older versions in mind?
