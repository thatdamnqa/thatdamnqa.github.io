talk: There's more to code review than you might think
event: Software Test Group Hamburg (English)
when: October 2017
---

I'm currently on a contract in Germany, so what better excuse to give a talk at the local testers usergroup?

>So, you do code reviews, and that's great. But there's always more that you can check during the review. More places you can check for any potential bugs or problems before deployment, before you find yourself with technical debt. Or worse: unforeseen downtime.
>
> In this talk I will be going through the things that you should be checking to ensure confidence for developers, project owners and stakeholders. We'll be looking at documentation, commit messages, and common code problems, with examples and tips along the way.
