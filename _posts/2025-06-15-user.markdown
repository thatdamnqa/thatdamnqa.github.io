I don’t like the term “user” when talking in the context of testing and requirements. It’s too vague of a term, and it doesn’t tell you what the person might be thinking or expecting from the product.

Try forcing yourself to use another word instead. It might make you think more about the feature in question.

Why not try:
* Customer
* Client
* Bill-payer
* Account holder
* Operator
* Reader
* Poster
* Viewer
* Listener
* Player
* Streamer
* Message sender
* Message receiver
* Caller
* Child
* Parent/Guardian
* Teacher
* Student
* Reporter
* Engineer
* Technician
* Subscriber
* Moderator
* Administrator
* Photographer
* Athlete
* Planner
* Customer service assistant
* Shopper
* Person who wants to use your product to do bad things
