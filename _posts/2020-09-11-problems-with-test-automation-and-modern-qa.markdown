Amir Ghahrai has written a fantastic article about Test Automation, and says something which I’ve been thinking about a
lot:

> Manual testing has lost its virtue, thanks to development practices and cultures such as agile and DevOps, which have
> created a divide in the QA space - those who can code and those who can’t.

I urge you all to [read it](https://devqa.io/problems-test-automation-modern-qa/), it’s a well thought out post about
the pitfalls of test automation and the process it creates.

My view on the recent DevOps/CI/CD culture is that “write code, commit it, hit build and automation checks the code
works before it automatically goes live” is dangerous.

Sure, automated tests can be good (if done well). But
[there’s far, far more to QA than that](https://www.developsense.com/blog/2014/10/testing-is/).
