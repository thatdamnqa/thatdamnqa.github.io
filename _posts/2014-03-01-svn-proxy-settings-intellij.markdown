Proxy settings in OS X are weird. If you use SVN, Intellij wants to be different.

You need to set the proxy settings for each project if you're behind a project. Do this by going to
`Settings -> Version Control -> Subversion` and make your changes. If you have the proxy settings set up in IntelliJ
you may want to just use those -- or you can set up your own individual settings in there.

So there we have it.
