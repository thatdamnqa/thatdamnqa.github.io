I spent some time tonight speaking with Michael Bolton, about automation. Something he said that could be done really struck me:

>He set things up to alert him whenever there was a significant variation in how long functions took.  At least half the time, a change in timing would cause a developer to say "hmmm... there's a bug."

That's totally going into my bag of tricks.
