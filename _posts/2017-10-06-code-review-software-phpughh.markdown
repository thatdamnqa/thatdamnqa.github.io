event: PHP Usergroup Hamburg

Not content with speaking at the local tester's group, I'll also be speaking at the local php usergroup next week. I'll be giving a 20 minute version of my code review talk.

>So, you do code reviews, and that's great. But there's always more that you can check during the review. More places you can check for any potential bugs or problems before deployment, before you find yourself with technical debt. Or worse: unforeseen downtime.
>
> In this talk I will be going through the things that you should be checking to ensure confidence for developers, project owners and stakeholders. We'll be looking at documentation, commit messages, and common code problems, with examples and tips along the way.
