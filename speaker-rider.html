    <h2>Speaker rider</h2>

    <p>I love public speaking. I love doing it, and I love listening to it. However, the world and specifically my craft
        of
        Software Testing/Development needs to hear from more diverse voices, and I hope to play a part in achieving that
        with
        this speaker rider.</p>

    <p>If you’re interested in having me speak at your conference, you can find numerous ways to contact me in the
        footer.</p>

    <p>This rider is a work in progress and will take effect for all new agreements I make with events from the date of
        publishing. All clauses in this rider apply to <strong>commercial conferences</strong>. Meetups, community
        events
        and potentially some not for profit events are not subject to my rider.</p>

    <h3>Not PayToSpeak</h3>
    <p><strong>An event will cover travel costs (flights, taxis, buses, trains, ferries) and accommodation for ALL
        speakers</strong></p>

    <p>If the term PayToSpeak is new to you, it means where it ends up costing you money to talk at a conference,
        usually
        specifically focused on travel and accommodation. PayToSpeak conferences act as a barrier to those who don’t
        have
        support from their employer, or have enough disposable income to fund themselves, and let’s be honest we all
        have
        better ways to spend our money then to increase the profits of a conference. PayToSpeak conferences are a plague
        on
        our industry and tend to have a more corporate angle to them, and self-promotion, than trying to improve the
        community and the sector they represent.</p>

    <p>Where a flight is required, your event will cover an economy airfare on the days of travel that work for me. If
        it’s
        a long flight and a significant change in timezone I will insist on travelling a few days before, to give me at
        least one rest day. This is actually of benefit to your event, as I will be adjusted and have more energy for my
        session. Those extra days at a hotel will be covered by your event if for the reason above. I aim to never leave
        a
        conference early (sometimes personal reasons dictate this), I don’t believe it’s fair on attendees who have paid
        good money to listen and chat with the speakers. So, if I can’t travel home on the evening the conference ends,
        then
        the event will cover that additional night. Again, it benefits the conference.</p>

    <p>My travel to and from my main means of transport should also be covered, such as taxis/buses/trams/trains to the
        airport and to the hotel. If it so happens that I can drive to your event, then I will be reimbursed per mile/km
        at
        the government rate, so for the UK, this would be 45p per mile. This specific rule I am more lenient on, and I
        will
        only ask for reimbursement if the cost is higher than the cost of a regular commute for a day job.</p>


    <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
    <p><strong>An event will have a code of conduct</strong></p>

    <p>Your event will have an inclusive and enforced code of conduct. It’s hard to know if an event will enforce their
        code
        of conduct or just list one to appear inclusive. However, people talk and usually, news spreads when code of
        conducts are not being enforced, plus physical things should be present at the event which usually aid in
        believing
        if it will be enforced or not. Code of conducts are designed to create a safe environment for all attendees,
        they
        are needed.</p>

    <h3>Diverse Speakers</h3>
    <strong>
        <ul>
            <li>An event will have a minimum of 20% women speakers</li>
            <li>An event will have at least one speaker who is a person of colour, BAME</li>
            <li>An event will have at least one first time speaker</li>
        </ul>
    </strong>

    <p>The majority of conferences interpret diversity as male and female speakers, I believe diversity is far more than
        this, but it’s also a complicated space, and one I’ve personally found difficult to write about in an inclusive
        manner. So, if my choice of words offends anyone, it’s not my intention at all, and I’m open to
        improvements.</p>

    <p>I want to speak on lineups that contain at least 20% women speakers, selected for their subjects and expertise,
        not
        their gender. A lot of events have done fantastic work to increase their number of women speakers, it’s not
        difficult to achieve if you put the work in. I’ve specifically mentioned 20% as I believe that a conference can
        reach this target with effort. I’m of course not excluding other gender identities and would love to see lineups
        containing as many as possible.</p>

    <p>In short, what I’m trying to say is a speaker line up consisting of only white people is not acceptable to me.
        The
        world is a diverse and beautiful place, I want to hear from all who call it home. So if you are as a person of
        colour, or prefer BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) or another term, what I’m trying to say is I’m here to
        support you.</p>

    <p>The tech industry needs to hear from many more voices than it currently does, therefore I’ll only support events
        that
        encourage and provide places for new speakers. Conferences that factor in the majority of what I’ve already
        mentioned tend to appeal to new voices, and they are better for it.</p>


    <blockquote>In an ideal scenario, I’d like to see as many gender identities, ethnical backgrounds, ages and races as
        possible
    </blockquote>

    <p>I echo this sentence from Karolina Szczur.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This isn’t an exhaustive list. I aim to treat this as a living document and continue to improve as my views
        change. I
        strongly urge you to adopt something similar for your own believes and ethics on inclusion. I want to see more
        change, and I hope my actions bring it and inspire others to take a similar stance and question the status
        quo.</p>

    <p>This rider was taken from Richard Bradshaw and slightly modified. It was Richard's actions which has inspired me
        to
        create my own rider. Massive thanks to him for allowing me to use it.</p>
