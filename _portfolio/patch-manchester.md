Patch:Manchester was a monthly usergroup/meetup with the aim of increasing open source contributions. We meet once a
month (last monday of the month!), and do some work on either the featured project, or any other project we like.

Responsibilities included:

* General meetup.com, Twitter and technw calendar administration
* Liaising with Madlab, our venue hosts
* Working with other usergroup organisers/stakeholders within the Manchester tech scene
* Welcoming new members to the meetings
