In 2014, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy game release, the BBC released a
30th anniversary edition of the game. I was asked to test the game during the final stages of development, working with
project managers, developers, designers, and members of the team who worked alongside Douglas Adams during the creation
of the original 1984 release.

Keeping the same gameplay and game engine of the 20th Anniversary Edition, the 30th Anniversary edition expands and
improves the game by including redrawn graphics, an improved cross-browser interface created in HTML5, and Twitter
integration.

* Cross-browser testing
* Working with remote team-members
* Performance testing/analysis
